# Transparent Replugged! - AKA TransparentCord

This is my original work so feel free to use / edit it however you want.</br></br>
Found something that isn't trasparent that should be? Either fix it and [create a PR](https://github.com/JJ-VP/transparent-replugged/pulls), or [create an issue](https://github.com/JJ-VP/transparent-replugged/issues/new/choose) and let me know where the find the element.

### What does this theme do?

It simple makes as many elements as possible transparent. No layout changes, no fancy features, just transparency.

## Q&A

Q: Can I change the background image?</br>
A: Yes, but also No. In the release version, No. You would have to clone the repo and edit the index.css to change the background-image url to an image of your choice.</br></br>
Q: Can I change the background dim?</br>
A: Same as above, except this time you are changing the linear-gradient alpha (thats the last number of the rgba 0 = no dim, 1 = fully dimmed)
