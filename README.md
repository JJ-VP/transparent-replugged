# Transparent Replugged!

This is my original work so feel free to use / edit it however you want.

## Q&A

Q: Can I change the background image?</br>
A: Yes, but also No. In the release version, No. You would have to clone the repo and edit the main.css to change the background-image url to an image of your choice.</br></br>
Q: Can I change the background dim?</br>
A: Same as above, except this time you are changing the linear-gradient alpha (thats the last number of the rgba 0 = no dim, 1 = fully black)
